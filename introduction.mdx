title: Introduction to XState
description: Actor-based state management and orchestration for complex app logic
---

XState is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It has zero dependencies, and is useful for frontend and backend application logic.

It uses event-driven programming, state machines, statecharts, and the actor model to handle complex logic in predictable, robust, and visual ways. XState provides a powerful and flexible way to manage application and workflow state by allowing developers to model logic as actors and state machines.

## Why XState?

Statecharts are a formalism for modeling stateful, reactive systems. This is useful for declaratively describing the behavior of your application, from the individual components to the overall application logic.

XState helps you:

- **Prevent impossible states** - Your state machines can only be in one state at a time, eliminating entire classes of bugs
- **Visualize your logic** - Use Stately Studio to create, edit, and visualize your state machines
- **Test comprehensively** - Generate test paths automatically from your state machine logic
- **Handle side effects** - Manage async operations, timers, and other side effects in a predictable way
