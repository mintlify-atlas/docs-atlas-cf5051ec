description: Visual state machine editor and collaboration platform
---

Stately Studio is a visual editor for creating, editing, and collaborating on state machines and statecharts. It provides powerful tools for designing application logic visually and exporting to XState v5.

## Getting Started

Create your first state machine in seconds:

</Card>

## Key Features

### Visual Editor

Stately Studio provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for building state machines:

- **State creation** - Add states, transitions, and events visually
- **Nested states** - Build hierarchical state machines with ease
- **Parallel states** - Design concurrent workflows
- **Actions and guards** - Configure entry/exit actions and transition guards
- **Context and events** - Define machine data and event types

### Live Simulation

Test your machines interactively:

- **Event simulation** - Send events and watch state transitions
- **State inspection** - View current state and context values
- **Time travel** - Step backward and forward through state changes
- **Path exploration** - Visualize all possible paths through your machine

### Export to XState

Generate clean, production-ready XState v5 code:

```typescript
// Exported from Stately Studio
import { setup, createActor } from 'xstate';

const machine = setup({
  types: {} as {
    context: { count: number };
    events: { type: 'INCREMENT' } | { type: 'DECREMENT' };
  }
}).createMachine({
  id: 'counter',
  initial: 'active',
  context: { count: 0 },
  states: {
    active: {
      on: {
        INCREMENT: {
          actions: assign({
            count: ({ context }) => context.count + 1
          })
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Documentation Generation

Stately Studio automatically generates:

- **State documentation** - Descriptions of each state
- **Transition tables** - All events and transitions
- **Path coverage** - Test paths through the machine
- **Sequence diagrams** - Event flow visualizations

Use generated docs for:
- Team communication
- Requirements documentation
- Test planning
- Architecture reviews

## Stately Sky

Deploy and run your state machines in the cloud:

- **Hosted workflows** - Run machines without infrastructure
- **Event ingestion** - Send events via API
- **State persistence** - Automatically persist machine state
- **Monitoring** - Track machine execution
- **Webhooks** - React to state changes

## VS Code Extension

The [Stately VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) brings Stately Studio into your editor:

- Visualize machines directly in VS Code
- Edit machines and sync changes to code
- Navigate between states and code
- Autocomplete for state names and events

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode).

## Stately Inspect

Debug running state machines:

```typescript
import { createActor } from 'xstate';
import { createBrowserInspector } from '@statelyai/inspect';

const inspector = createBrowserInspector();

const actor = createActor(machine, {
  inspect: inspector.inspect
}).start();
```

Inspect:
- Current state and context
- Event history
- Transition logs
- Spawned actors

## Best Practices

### Keep Machines Focused

- Design single-responsibility machines
- Use actor composition for complex workflows
- Avoid deeply nested state hierarchies

### Use Descriptive Names

- Name states clearly (e.g., "loadingUser" not "loading")
- Use semantic event names (e.g., "SUBMIT_FORM" not "CLICK")
- Document intent with state descriptions

### Test Paths Visually

- Use simulation to test happy and error paths
- Verify all states are reachable
- Check for impossible states

### Version Control

- Export machines to version control
- Use Studio's version history for iterations
- Tag releases with meaningful versions

### Document Decisions

- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Use descriptions for states and transitions
- Share context with your team
