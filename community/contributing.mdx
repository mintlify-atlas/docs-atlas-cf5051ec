## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Latest version of Node.js
- pnpm package manager

### Setup

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [XState repository](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate)
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This is a monorepo containing XState, @xstate/store, and related packages.

## Making Changes

Pull requests are encouraged! If you want to add a feature or fix a bug:

### Step 1: Create a Branch

[Create a separate branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes

Make your changes and write tests that validate your change and/or fix.

### Step 3: Run Tests

Run the appropriate test suite:

```bash
# For all packages
pnpm test

# For core XState only
pnpm test:core

# For @xstate/store only
pnpm test:store
```

### Step 4: Type Check

Ensure there are no TypeScript errors:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

### Step 5: Create a Changeset

Create a changeset describing your changes:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

When creating a changeset:
- Provide a short description of the changes
- Include a code example if applicable
- Focus on details relevant to developers using the package
- Avoid implementation details

Learn more about [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets).

### Step 6: Push and Open a PR

Push your branch and open a pull request:

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

PRs are reviewed promptly and merged within a day or two (or even within an hour) if everything looks good!

## Submit an Issue

Issues and bug reports are encouraged. If you want to submit an issue:

### Before Submitting

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/issues) to check if your issue already exists or has been solved
2. Check the [documentation](https://stately.ai/docs) to see if your question is answered there

### Creating an Issue

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/issues/new/choose)
2. Choose the appropriate issue template
3. Fill out all details in the template to help us understand the issue
4. Include:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Code examples or reproduction links
   - XState version

We'll try to respond promptly and address your issue as soon as possible.

## Contributing Examples

Our [examples](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/tree/main/examples) are self-contained apps that show how to:
- Solve common problems
- Integrate with other frameworks (Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Build something fun with XState

To contribute an example, please read the [examples readme](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/blob/main/examples/readme.md).

## Contributing to Documentation

The [Stately and XState docs](https://stately.ai/docs) are in a separate repository. See the [docs contribution guide](https://github.com/statelyai/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

### Legacy Documentation

The legacy docs at [xstate.js.org/docs](https://xstate.js.org/docs) are in the `/docs` folder of the main XState repository. They are built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Build System

### Building Packages

We use [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/) to build packages. During development, preconstruct creates redirecting files that always use source files from the monorepo.

This happens automatically during the `postinstall` step. If you build packages manually, you may need to restore these files:

```bash
pnpm postinstall
```

### Publishing

We use [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to manage releases:

1. Contributors create changesets describing their changes
2. When changesets are merged to main, a release PR is automatically prepared
3. When the release PR is merged, packages are automatically published

You don't need to worry about versioning or publishing—just create your changeset!

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Test both TypeScript types and runtime behavior

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear commit messages
- Update documentation if you change APIs
- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Be patient—maintainers will review as soon as possible!

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, feel free to:

- Ask in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/discussions)
- Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xstate)
- Tag maintainers in your PR or issue

We're here to help and appreciate your contributions!

## Recognition

All contributors are recognized in:
- The GitHub contributors list
- Release notes (via changesets)
- The community

Thank you for making XState better! 🎉
